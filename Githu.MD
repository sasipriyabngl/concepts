GIT
We should use source code management system for

Version control
Track the changes
Review the changes
Security and Backup
Branching
Collaboration
Git is a popular distributed/decentralized control system.

Centralized System Disadvantages
Single point of failure
It means centralized systems can't maintain multiple copies. If the central server is down or crashed entire history is gone.
Limited offline Access
You should always connect with Internet to push the changes.
Risk of Data Loss
If a developer accidentally commits or pushes incorrect or unfinished changes to the central repository, it can affect the entire team's codebase. This makes it crucial to be cautious and vigilant when committing changes.
Many more
Branching and working together is very difficult in Centralized systems.
Distributed Systems
Distributed version control system always have local copy in every developer laptop, so the history is preserved everywhere.
Single laptop is enough when the entire system is crashed including Git server.
Staging area is there where can selectively send the changes to the central repo. He can send completed changes and keep working on in-progress features.
Developers can work offline with local repos.
